## Skill Identity

- Skill name: `xaml-csharp-development-skill-for-avalonia`
- Primary definition: [`SKILL.md`](SKILL)
- Main reference index: [`references/compendium.md`](references/compendium)
- Avalonia upstream repository: [AvaloniaUI/Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia)

## Avalonia Version Coverage

This skill is currently pinned to Avalonia **11.3.12**.

- API references and guidance are aligned to `11.3.12` behavior.
- Generated API indexing is expected to use `--git-ref 11.3.12`.
- Guidance should avoid relying on `master`-only APIs unless a document explicitly states that exception.

This repository also now carries a dedicated preview migration lane for Avalonia 12:

- latest verified preview tag: **`12.0.0-preview2`**
- release date of that preview: **March 5, 2026**
- verification date for this lane: **March 14, 2026**
- curated migration chapter: [`references/68-avalonia-12-preview2-migration-guide.md`](references/68-avalonia-12-preview2-migration-guide)
- generated break/new API catalog: [`references/69-avalonia-12-preview2-breaking-changes-and-new-api-catalog.md`](references/69-avalonia-12-preview2-breaking-changes-and-new-api-catalog)
- generated preview API index: [`references/api-index-12.0.0-preview2-generated.md`](references/api-index-12.0.0-preview2-generated)
- official upstream Avalonia breaking-change docs are referenced from the migration guide, including the `v12 Breaking Changes` wiki page

As of **February 15, 2026**, this repository is maintained against the 11.3.12 release line.

## Scope

This skill covers app-development-facing Avalonia topics, including:

- App startup and lifetime wiring (desktop, single-view, activity hooks)
- XAML compilation and runtime loading patterns
- Compiled bindings, typed templates, and data/template composition
- Styling, theming, resources, and asset packaging
- Professional UI/UX design systems, token architecture, typography, spacing, motion, and component variants
- Microsoft Fluent design system mapping, `FluentTheme` palette customization, and density tuning
- Controls, templates, input/focus, layout, rendering, and animation
- Platform services (storage provider, clipboard, launcher, drag/drop, screens)
- Diagnostics, performance, testing, accessibility, and troubleshooting
- Avalonia 12 preview migration planning and execution, while keeping stable defaults on 11.3.12

It includes both curated guidance and a generated API index for signature lookup.

## Out of Scope

This skill is not intended to be:

- A full Avalonia internals/source-contributor guide
- A replacement for upstream API docs or source browsing
- A mandate to use unstable/private APIs in production code

When internals are mentioned, it is usually for diagnostics, constraints, or behavioral explanation.

  - latest-preview verification pinned to `12.0.0-preview2` as of March 14, 2026,
  - official breaking changes from Avalonia package-validation suppressions (`references/69-avalonia-12-preview2-breaking-changes-and-new-api-catalog.md`),
  - full preview public-signature lookup (`references/api-index-12.0.0-preview2-generated.md`),
  - official upstream wiki references folded into the guide, including the `v12 Breaking Changes` page,
  - migration guidance for binding moves, compiled-binding defaults, storage-provider and data-transfer migration, `PseudolassesExtensions` to `PseudoClassesExtensions`, Android bootstrap changes, modern window decorations, and major new preview APIs such as page navigation, command bars, `TextOptions`, `CompiledBinding.Create`, and `IPresentationSource`.

These are designed to reduce accidental drift to unreleased APIs.

## Regenerating API Index (Pinned)

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_api_index.py \
  --repo <path-to-avalonia-repo> \
  --git-ref 11.3.12 \
  --output references/api-index-generated.md
```

Recommended checks after regeneration:

- Verify key startup/binding/platform signatures still match references.
- Audit docs for master-only APIs introduced by mistake.
- Update this README and [`SKILL.md`](SKILL) if version coverage changes.

Preview lane regeneration:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_api_index.py \
  --repo <path-to-avalonia-repo> \
  --git-ref 12.0.0-preview2 \
  --output references/api-index-12.0.0-preview2-generated.md \
  --max-per-file 100000

python3 scripts/generate_api_migration_report.py \
  --repo <path-to-avalonia-repo> \
  --from-ref 11.3.12 \
  --to-ref 12.0.0-preview2 \
  --output references/69-avalonia-12-preview2-breaking-changes-and-new-api-catalog.md
```

## Maintenance Checklist for New Avalonia Release

1. Switch target release tag (for example `11.3.x` -> `11.4.x`).
2. Regenerate [`references/api-index-generated.md`](references/api-index-generated) from the new tag.
3. Diff critical APIs referenced by docs.
4. Update affected reference files.
5. Update:
   - [`README.md`](README)
   - [`SKILL.md`](SKILL)
   - [`references/compendium.md`](references/compendium)
6. If maintaining the preview lane, refresh the preview migration guide, generated preview API index, and generated migration report against the latest preview tag.

## Quality Bar

Skill guidance should remain:

- Version-accurate to the declared release
- Explicit about tradeoffs (trim/AOT/runtime dynamic paths)
- Focused on production-safe defaults (compiled XAML + compiled bindings)
- Structured for rapid task execution and review
