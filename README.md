# Development Plugin for Avalonia

Codex plugin for building, reviewing, designing, porting, and migrating Avalonia applications with focused skills instead of one oversized catch-all skill.

## License

This repository is licensed under the MIT License. See `LICENSE` for the full terms.

## Plugin Identity

- Plugin name: `development-plugin-for-avalonia`
- Plugin manifest: [`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`](.codex-plugin/plugin.json)
- Canonical umbrella workflow: [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md)
- Repo-local umbrella skill: [`.agents/skills/development-plugin-for-avalonia/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/development-plugin-for-avalonia/SKILL.md)
- Specialist skills: [`skills/`](skills)
- Shared reference index: [`references/compendium.md`](references/compendium.md)
- Avalonia upstream repository: [AvaloniaUI/Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia)

## Discovery Model

This repo now supports both Codex discovery paths at the same time:

- Repo-local skill discovery uses [`.agents/skills/development-plugin-for-avalonia/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/development-plugin-for-avalonia/SKILL.md) as the broad entrypoint when Codex is working inside this checkout.
- Plugin discovery uses [`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`](.codex-plugin/plugin.json), which exposes the focused skills under [`skills/`](skills).
- Repo marketplace discovery can use [`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`](.agents/plugins/marketplace.json), which points back to this repo root as the plugin directory.

The repo-local skill is intentionally thin. It forwards broad requests into the focused plugin skills and shared references instead of duplicating the full guidance.
The root [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) is the canonical umbrella workflow source, not the repo-local discovery entrypoint.

## Local Install

This repository now includes a repo marketplace file at [`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`](.agents/plugins/marketplace.json).

That makes local testing easier:

- from this checkout, Codex can read the repo marketplace and find the plugin without creating a separate personal marketplace just for local testing
- for personal install, you can still copy the plugin to `~/.codex/plugins/` and add an entry to `~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`

This repo intentionally uses the repository root as the plugin root, so the repo marketplace keeps `source.path` at `./` instead of copying the plugin under `./plugins/`.

The repo marketplace name is intentionally distinct from the plugin name so Codex can present the marketplace source and the plugin identity separately.

The plugin manifest now uses plugin-specific PNG assets for `composerIcon` and `logo` so the plugin directory can render branded artwork from common image formats.

## Avalonia Version Coverage

This plugin is pinned to Avalonia **11.3.12** for default implementation guidance.

- API references and guidance are aligned to `11.3.12`.
- Generated stable API indexing is expected to use `--git-ref 11.3.12`.
- Guidance should avoid relying on `master`-only APIs unless a document explicitly states that exception.

This repository also carries a dedicated Avalonia 12 migration lane:

- curated migration chapter: [`references/68-avalonia-12-migration-guide.md`](references/68-avalonia-12-migration-guide.md)
- generated break/new API catalog: [`references/69-avalonia-12-breaking-changes-and-new-api-catalog.md`](references/69-avalonia-12-breaking-changes-and-new-api-catalog.md)
- generated Avalonia 12 API index: [`references/api-index-12.0.0-rc1-generated.md`](references/api-index-12.0.0-rc1-generated.md)
